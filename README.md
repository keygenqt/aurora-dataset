# Data Set for Aurora OS

![picture](https://github.com/keygenqt/aurora-dataset/blob/main/files/repo/preview.png?raw=true)

Knowledge base for Aurora OS. You can train your models, search and find an answer to your question.
I chose [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/index.html) as the format for saving the database.
I think it will be convenient for such a task. Well, and finally, we will find a use for it.

### Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains python scripts that simplify working with dataset.
Their functionality will be improved over time.

- `pkl.py` - installing and updating pkl, generating dump of the required format.
- `stats.py` - outputting statistics about dataset.
- `uts.py` - working with unix timestamp.
- `validate.py` - validating pkl data.

Any script can be called from the root of the project.
For example, this is how you can create dump in json format:

```shell
scripts/pkl.py --dump json
```

### Text Format

The HTML format is used, in abbreviated form: [HTML style](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style).
Suitable for telegram bots and all other parsers. Example message **>[here](https://github.com/keygenqt/aurora-dataset/blob/main/collection/dataset.pkl#L21)<**.
